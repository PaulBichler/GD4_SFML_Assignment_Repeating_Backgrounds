# GD4_SFML_Assignment_Repeating_Backgrounds
 
My approach to create an infinitely scrolling background in SFML. Instead of moving the player and the camera up, I decided to keep them stationary and instead scroll the background texture down. To make the scrolling infinite, I used two textures that constantely alternate.
